The eyeâ€¦.We never really appreciate this amazing part of us that really makes this life a beautiful one.

## But what about those who just werenâ€™t lucky enough to take in this beauty?

The tech world is advancing at a very rapid pace  and so are all the tech around us.
Today is a time when one canâ€™t even imagine life without a smartphoneâ€¦.
But we forget that there are some who use touch to complete every task in their lives but cannot use a touch screen phone all because they are differently abled.
Well that had to change. 

## The Idea and Mission

ðŸ’Ž We at Flu_Kannu have put all our efforts into making the first level of a voice recognition based app to help the visually challenged use voice command to perform all the functions of a smartphone, from sending emails to searching the web.

Just like how one doesnâ€™t judge a book by its cover, our prototype is just a glimpse of an app that could one day become the life changer for many, as this piece of code holds the potential to break down all those barriers which leave owning a smartphone still a dream for many  from the visually challenged community.

## Future Enhancements
As of now, the app is still a work in progress and has a long way to go into becoming that life changer we visualize it to be, but go we will until the day we make this dream come true for our differently abled friends.
